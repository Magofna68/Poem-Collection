        her joyous smile and loving embrace,
        A forsaken pleasure lost in the sands of illusion.
        At the flick of an eye, we're back at Resolution.
        I realized As you got lost in the music, lost in the night,
        I want to walk by your side, hand in hand through my life
        You brighten my day, you're my morning sun,
        Moon of my life, what have I done?
        The ball drops, as I drop the ball,
        I failed to appreciate you all in all.
        Like a precious gem, you stole my heart,
        In loving embrace, You deserve a new start,
        Your my candle in darkness, my guiding light,
        so be free my love, I'll let go without fight,
        I pray you bless the world with your smile,
        Live, laugh, & love; meanwhile,
        I make you this promise-as of tonight,
        To love & respect you, to do what is right,
        once you've recovered and regained your sight,
        Should you choose to return, I'll wait day and night.
        I recognize now, that night at Resolution,
        A perfect depiction; I chose you as my solution
        A forsaken pleasure lost in the sands of illusion.
        her joyous smile and loving embrace,
        The silence; it envelop's me."`
