        her joyous smile and loving embrace,
        A forsaken pleasure lost in the sands of illusion.
        At the flick of an eye, we're back at Resolution.
        I realized As you got lost in the music, lost in the night,
        I want to walk by your side, hand in hand through my life
        You brighten my day, you're my morning sun,
        Moon of my life, what have I done?
        The ball drops, as I drop the ball,
        I failed to appreciate you all in all.
        Like a precious gem, you stole my heart,
        In loving embrace, You deserve a new start,
        Your my candle in darkness, my guiding light,
        so be free my love, I'll let go without fight,
        I pray you bless the world with your smile,
        Live, laugh, & love; meanwhile,
        I make you this promise-as of tonight,
        To love & respect you, to do what is right,
        once you've recovered and regained your sight,
        Should you choose to return, I'll wait day and night.
        I recognize now, that night at Resolution,
        A perfect depiction; I chose you as my solution
        A forsaken pleasure lost in the sands of illusion.
        her joyous smile and loving embrace,
        The silence; it envelop's me."`

    text: `"Waves of sorrow wash over my soul
    As my heart plunges into a steep abyss.
    Mankind’s strength of memory falls short of grandeur as sickening misgiving acts repeat as the tormenting slaughter eats at my being.
    It feeds through my body, encompassing all space, and slowly depleting my soul of its inner nature. The havoc lays siege to my chest, numbing all prior signs of emergency.
    I clutch in despair to relished memories, only to have them further extinguished by the blazing fires of mistakes.
    My selfishness and self pity quickly overtook respect and loving embrace. My greatest strength goes without optimal utilization; my sheet pure as light.
    Living an Unscrutinized life, my failings spiral, losing the thing most precious to me. In this slump I present myself, I need elevation. Something to prop me up from my station.
    I am enlightened by every spot that went wrong,
    but the ending to our story has already begun,
    I am undone by my actions, undone by my thoughts,
    I am a lone astronaut left to suffer my fate in the face of the the immeasurable vastness of space.
    I slowly slip into darkness; no salvation, canvas of chaos seizes life through creation,
    I am the master of puppets pulling strings behind scene, I am the artist behind brush who’s scheme turned routine.
    I burned my bridge, lost my sight,
    through the clouds of smoke I’ll continue the fight,
    To right my wrongs, a story unfinished,
    But perhaps my time is already finished."`

    15 years I thought i’d sinned,
    a count of 8 till this very day,
    is the amount of times, i’ve been led astray.
    somehow, I come back stronger,
    every time I fall I’m down for longer,
    no matter how hard someone beats me down, 
    I’ll step it up and rise from the ground,
    Never lost and never will,
    Destined to win I will fulfill, 
    The prophecy of pain, for myself, the crown,
    I will stand and gain my ground,
    Cant be beat and can’t be touched,
    Thats when all the haters rush,
    To beat me down, to win the round,
    It’s at that time that i’ll be found,
    broken, bare, and standing there,
    arms up high  attack them quick,
    they just keep fighting, they just can’t quit,
    Soon enough they’ll see their graves,
    It’s at that time they can’t be saved,
    Depressed and angered, they just can’t choose,
    Because finally they understand… I can’t lose.

    text: `"Beauty is the wind rustling through the trees,
    the warm hot sun and scent of ocean breeze,
    it is the sunlight dancing around in her hair,
    her radiating presence is well beyond compare.
    
    Beauty is the soft, calm, rhythmic water,
    being bathed in sunlight; getting hotter and hotter,
    It is the gleam contained within her dazzling smile,
    her sensual skin and unraveling style.
    
    Beauty is witnessing birds lay claim to the sky,
    the flare of the wind and the clouds drifting by,
    It is the absolute polarity of flaws and perfections,
    tainted from Eden, yet angel in reflection.
    
    Beauty is her laughter as it envelop’s my soul,
    I give up thoughts and emotions, as they seize from control,
    Just her presence ultimately uplifts my day,
    A wild-free spirit roaming far and astray.
    
    Beauty is the declining daylight of the suns last rays,
    It is not ever wanting the bond to sever,
    and hoping the moment lasts forever,
    Beauty is waking back up to reality."`,
